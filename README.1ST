Howto compile this bash for Windows?

Replace _0.6 by the version you downloaded.

compiling with mingw (I used mingw 3.2):

> unzip win-bash_0.6.zip
> cd win-bash_0.6
> make clean
> make

compiling with Visual C/C++ (I tested it with Visual C/C++ 6):

> unzip win-bash_0.6.zip
> cd win-bash_0.6
> clean.bat
> make_vc.bat

=> find your bash.exe in v01/bash-1.14.2/Bash/WinDebug
