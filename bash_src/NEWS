This file documents the bugs fixed between this release, bash-1.14.2,
and the last bash release, 1.14.1.

1.  Bugs fixed in Bash

a.  Command name completion inside command substitution constructs now
    works.

b.  Command word completion now performs tilde expansion to avoid passing
    filenames with tildes to stat().

c.  Fixed a bug in brace completion that caused core dumps when there was
    only one completion.

d.  Fixed `getopts' to work when $# > 9

e.  Fixed a typo in getopts which causes OPTIND to be set to bad values.

f.  Fixed a bug in `read' which left stray escape characters in strings when
    reading \<newline>

g.  Fixed `read' to dequote strings before assigning them to variables if any
    backslash-escaped characters were read.

h.  Fixed a memory leak in `read' when no variable names were supplied.

i.  Changed calls to signal() that installed a handler to set_signal_handler().

j.  Fixed a Makefile problem so that $(CC) is passed to makes in all library
    subdirectories.

k.  Fixed a typo in cpp-Makefile which prevented `bashbug' from installing

l.  Fixed a bug in the input buffering code which occasionally caused the
    fd bash was using to read a script to be closed unexpectedly.

m.  Fixed a bug in the job control code which caused core dumps when commands
    were run from a SIGCHLD trap

n.  Fixed a bug in the job control code so that script jobs dying due to
    SIGINT don't make the shell think it got a SIGINT also

o.  Fixes to machine descriptions:  SunOS, SVR4.2, SCO, hpux_8, hpux_9, SVR4,
    RiscOS, DG AViiON

p.  New machine descriptions: tahoe/4.3BSD, m68k/NetBSD, i860/SVR4,
    tandem/SVR3

q.  Fixed an incorrect declaration of sbrk() on hpux_9

r.  Added a test for OPENDIR_NOT_ROBUST to the `portbash' scripts

s.  Fixed a redundant declaration of sys_siglist on FreeBSD

t.  Fixed a bug in the variable assignment code which tried to expand tildes
    in some contexts even if they were quoted

u.  Fixed a bug in process substitution that manifested itself on systems
    with /dev/fd and caused the file descriptor to be closed inappropriately

v.  Added code to `support/mksysdefs' to compensate for problems in some
    versions of i386 SVR4.2

w.  Fixes to the makefiles to make relative paths in `srcdir' work correctly

x.  Fixed an off-by-one error in the `test' builtin /dev/fd emulation

y.  Fixed a problem with function execution that prevented `break' and
    `continue' from working across `return'

z.  Fixed a problem with `bind' that caused problems with readline when
    executed from ~/.bashrc.

aa. Fixed `support/mksysdefs' to run the correct version of `uname' on SCO

2.  Bugs fixed in Readline

a.  Signal handling was reworked to save and restore the signal mask and
    flags on Posix.1 systems

b.  Fixed a problem with skipping comment lines while reading the inputrc
    file

c.  Fixed a problem with quoted word break characters in the completion code

d.  Fixes to the display line wrapping code when using prompts with
    invisible characters

e.  Fixed problems with horizontal scrolling when using prompts with
    invisible characters

f.  A few problems which made the display code slower than necessary have
    been fixed.

g.  Fixed a problem with redisplay after a SIGWINCH was received, especially
    with multi-line prompts.

h.  The readline texinfo manual was thoroughly overhauled and all known
    mistakes fixed.

i.  Fixed a off-by-one error in the history buffer allocation code that
    sometimes caused the GNU malloc to abort

j.  Fixed a typo in the typedef declaring the history state structure

k.  Fixed readline to bind the arrow keys to default values after the
    inputrc and termcap capabilities are tested, not before

l.  Functions missing correct prologues were fixed.

m.  Fixed a bug that made readline misbehave after a command's output was
    flushed with ^O

n.  Fixed the tty code to call the functions that reset the meta key
    and keypad before putting the terminal driver back into icanon mode

3.  New Features in Bash

[none]

4.  New Features in Readline

a.  `insert-last-argument' now a standard part of the readline library

b.  Quoting of filenames by the completer may now be disabled by completion
    functions.

c.  Readline now uses the last column on terminals supporting autowrap

d.  Readline now sets up the 8-bit input and output defaults based on the
    value of $LC_CTYPE

e.  `history_stifled' variable replaced with history_is_stifled() function
